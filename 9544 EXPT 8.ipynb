    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The N-Queens problem is a classic problem in computer science that involves placing N chess queens on an N x N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens should be placed in the same row, column or diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code above solves the N-Queens problem using Prolog. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "The queens(N, Solution) predicate is the main entry point for the program. It takes an integer N as input, which represents the size of the chessboard, and returns a solution in the form of a list of coordinates (X,Y) representing the position of each queen on the board. The Solution variable is initially uninstantiated and will be bound to a solution by the predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of the queens predicate defines the range of the Solution list. It specifies that the list should contain N elements, each of which is a coordinate (X,Y) where X and Y are integers between 1 and N.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line of the queens predicate uses the findall predicate to generate a list of all possible solutions to the problem. The findall predicate takes three arguments: the first argument is a template for the solution (in this case, the uninstantiated Solution variable), the second argument is the goal to be satisfied (in this case, the safe predicate with Solution as its argument), and the third argument is the resulting list of solutions. This line generates a list of all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third line of the queens predicate selects the first solution from the list of possible solutions generated by the findall predicate. It uses the member predicate to iterate over the list of solutions until it finds a valid one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The safe predicate is the heart of the program. It checks whether a given solution is valid by ensuring that no two queens threaten each other. The safe predicate takes a list of coordinates as input and checks whether each queen is safe by checking whether it shares a row, column, or diagonal with any other queen in the list. The safe predicate is called recursively for each queen in the list, with the tail of the list passed as the argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base case for the safe predicate is an empty list, which is always safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive case for the safe predicate checks whether the head of the list (the current queen) is safe by ensuring that it does not share a row, column, or diagonal with any of the other queens in the list. If the current queen is safe, the predicate is called recursively on the tail of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The not predicate is used to negate the result of the member predicate in the queens predicate. This ensures that the first solution found by the program is returned, rather than all possible solutions.\n",
